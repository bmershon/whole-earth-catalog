# Whole Earth Catalog

A paper written for Nancy Maclean's Social Movements course taught at Duke University during the Spring 2015 semester. We were tasked with diving into primary sources, so I found just about the most exciting materials from the Rubenstein library that I could get my hands on. If I'm going to write a paper for a *Social Movements* history course, I could hardly have more fun than picking up the massive Whole Earth Catalog founded by the Merry Prankster, Stuart Brand.
